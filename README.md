## Why Porsche EV Insights?

I felt the Porsche app lacks the deeper insights that can be extracted from the trip data it collects. Porsche's My Porsche app lets you export trip data as CSV files, but analyzing that data isn't straightforward. **Porsche EV Insights** transforms your raw CSV exports into beautiful, actionable insights - all while keeping your data 100% private.

Now also supporting **Audi e-tron GT** - which shares the same J1 platform as the Taycan!

### Key Highlights

- **Your data stays yours** - Everything runs in your browser. No servers, no uploads, no tracking
- **Instant insights** - Understand your driving patterns, efficiency, and costs at a glance
- **Works offline** - Load once, use anywhere. Data persists in your browser

## Units & Currency Settings

The app supports multiple unit systems and currencies to match your preferences:

### Unit Systems

| Setting | Metric | Imperial (UK) | Imperial (US) |
|---------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Distance | km | mi | mi |
| Speed | km/h | mph | mph |
| Volume | L | gal (UK) | gal (US) |
| Default Currency | EUR (€) | GBP (£) | USD ($) |

### Consumption Formats

**Electric Consumption:**
- Metric: `kWh/100km` or `km/kWh`
- Imperial (UK): `mi/kWh`, `kWh/mi`, or `kWh/100mi`
- Imperial (US): `MPGe`, `mi/kWh`, `kWh/mi`, or `kWh/100mi`

**Note:** US users see EPA ratings and can display efficiency as MPGe (Miles Per Gallon equivalent). Other regions see WLTP ratings.

**Fuel Consumption (for comparison):**
- Metric: `L/100km` or `km/L`
- Imperial: `mpg`

### Supported Currencies

EUR, USD, GBP, CHF, CAD, AUD, JPY, CNY, SEK, NOK

## Getting Started

### Use Online

Visit **[porsche-ev.magicbytestudios.com](https://porsche-ev.magicbytestudios.com)** - no installation required.

### Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jpleite/porsche_ev_insights.git
cd porsche_ev_insights

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## How to Export Your Data

1. Open **My Porsche** app on your phone
2. Go to **Vehicle details**
3. Scroll down to **All trip data**
4. Tap the **download trip icon** (top right corner)
5. Select **"Since start"** and toggle **Download complete trip history**
6. Save or send by email
7. Select **"Since charging"** and make sure **Download complete trip history** toggle is on
8. Save or send by email
9. Transfer both CSV files to your computer
10. Upload them to Porsche EV Insights

The app supports both **"Since Start"** and **"Since Charge"** CSV exports (maximum 12 months limited by Porsche Connect). Uploading both files provides richer stats and information.

### How to Export Audi e-tron GT Data

1. Open **myAudi** app on your phone
2. Go to **Trips** or **Travel Data**
3. Tap **Export** or **Share**
4. Export as **ZIP file** (contains Short-term and Long-term memory CSVs)
5. Transfer the ZIP file to your computer
6. Upload the ZIP directly to Porsche EV Insights

Note: Audi exports are typically in imperial units (miles/mph) and are automatically converted to metric during import.

### Merging New Data

Since Porsche Connect only allows exporting the last 12 months of data, you may need to merge newer exports with your existing data:

1. Export fresh CSV files from My Porsche app
2. Open Porsche EV Insights with your existing data loaded (or restore a backup first)
3. Click **Import Data** and select **Merge** mode (instead of Replace)
4. Upload the new CSV files
5. The app will automatically detect and skip duplicate trips, adding only new ones

This way you can build up a complete history beyond the 12-month limit. Merging also works after restoring a backup, so you can keep a backup file and periodically merge new data into it.
